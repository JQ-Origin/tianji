# Reducing Alert Fatigue: Turning Noise into Actionable Signals

Alert fatigue happens when teams receive so many notifications that the truly critical ones get buried. The result: slow responses, missed incidents, and burned-out engineers. The goal of a modern alerting system is simple: only wake humans when action is required, include rich context to shorten time to resolution, and suppress everything else.

## Why Alert Fatigue Happens

Most organizations unintentionally create noisy alerting ecosystems. Common causes include:

1. Static thresholds that ignore diurnal patterns and seasonal traffic.
2. Duplicate alerts across tools without correlation or deduplication.
3. Health checks that confirm liveness but not correctness of user flows.
4. Paging for warnings instead of issues requiring immediate human action.
5. Missing maintenance windows and deployment-aware mute rules.

When every blip pages the on-call, people quickly learn to ignore pages—and that is the fastest way to miss real outages.

## Start With SLOs and Error Budgets

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) translate reliability goals into measurable targets. Error budgets (the allowable unreliability) help decide when to slow releases and when to page.

- Define user-centric SLOs: availability for core endpoints, latency at P95/P99, success rates for critical flows.
- Set page conditions based on budget burn rate, not just instantaneous values.
- Prioritize business-critical paths over peripheral features.

| Objective Type | Example SLO | Page When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Availability | 99.95% monthly | Error budget burn rate > 2% in 1 hour |
| Latency | P95 < 400ms for /checkout | Sustained breach for 10 minutes across 3 regions |
| Success Rate | 99.9% for login flow | Drop > 0.5% with concurrent spike in 5xx |

## Design Principles for Actionable Alerts

1. Page only for human-actionable issues. Everything else goes to review queues (email/Slack) or is auto-remediated.
2. Use correlation to reduce noise. Group related symptoms (API 5xx, DB latency, queue backlog) into a single incident.
3. Include diagnostic context in the first alert: recent deploy, top failing endpoints, region breakdown, related logs/metrics.
4. Implement escalation policies with rate limiting and cool-downs.
5. Respect maintenance windows and deploy windows automatically.
6. Use multi-signal detection: combine synthetic checks, server metrics, and real user signals (RUM/telemetry).

## From Reactive to Proactive: Synthetic + Telemetry

Reactive alerting waits for failures. Proactive systems combine synthetic monitoring (to test critical paths) and telemetry (to see real user impact).

- Synthetic monitoring validates complete flows: login → action → confirmation.
- Real User Monitoring reveals device/network/browser-specific degradations.
- Cross-region checks detect localized issues (DNS/CDN/regional outages).

With Tianji you can combine these signals in a unified timeline so responders see cause and effect in one place. See: [Feed overview](/docs/feed/intro), [State model](/docs/feed/state), and [Channels](/docs/feed/channels).

## Building a Quiet, Reliable On-Call

Implement these patterns to cut noise while improving MTTR:

### 1) Explicit Alert Taxonomy

- Critical: Page immediately; human action required; data loss/security/major outage.
- High: Notify on-call during business hours; fast follow-up; customer-impacting but contained.
- Info/Review: No page; log to feed; analyzed in post-incident or weekly review.

### 2) Deploy-Aware Alerting

- Tag telemetry and alerts with release versions and feature flags.
- Auto-create canary guardrails and roll back on breach.

### 3) Correlation and Deduplication

- Collapse cascades (e.g., DB down → API 5xx → frontend errors) into one incident.
- Attach root-cause candidates automatically (change events, infra incidents, quota limits).

### 4) Context-Rich Notifications

Include:

- Impacted SLO/SLA and current budget burn rate
- Top failing routes and exemplar traces
- Region/device breakdowns
- Recent changes (deploys/config/infra)
- Runbook link and one-click diagnostics

### 5) Progressive Escalation

- Start with Slack/email; escalate to SMS/call only if not acknowledged within target time.
- Apply per-service quiet hours and automatic silences during maintenance.

## Practical Metrics to Track

- Page volume per week (target declining trend)
- Percentage of pages that lead to real actions (>70% is a healthy target)
- Acknowledgement time (TTA) and time to restore (TTR)
- False positive rate and duplication rate
- Budget burn alerts avoided by early correlation

## How Tianji Helps

- Unified feed for events, alerts, and telemetry with a consistent [state model](/docs/feed/state) and flexible [channels](/docs/feed/channels).
- Lightweight server status reporting for CPU, memory, disk, and network: [server status reporter](/docs/server-status/server-status-reporter).
- Correlated timeline across checks, metrics, and user events to surface root causes faster.
- Extensible, open-source architecture so you control data and adapt alerts to your stack.

## Key Takeaways

1. Define SLOs and page on budget burn—not raw spikes.
2. Correlate symptoms into single incidents and include rich context.
3. Page only for human-actionable issues; escalate progressively.
4. Combine synthetic flows with telemetry for proactive detection.
5. Use Tianji to consolidate signals and reduce MTTR.

Quiet paging is achievable. Start by measuring what matters, suppressing the rest, and investing in context so every page moves responders toward resolution.
