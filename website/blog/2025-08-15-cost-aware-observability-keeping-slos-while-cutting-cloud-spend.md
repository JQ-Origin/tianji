# Cost-Aware Observability: Keep Your SLOs While Cutting Cloud Spend

Cloud costs are rising, data volumes keep growing, and yet stakeholders expect faster incident response with higher reliability. The answer is not “more data” but the right data at the right price. Cost-aware observability helps you preserve signals that protect user experience while removing expensive noise.

This guide shows how to re-think telemetry collection, storage, and alerting so you can keep your SLOs intact—without burning your budget.

## Why Cost-Aware Observability Matters

Traditional monitoring stacks grew by accretion: another exporter here, a new trace sampler there, duplicated logs everywhere. The result is ballooning ingest and storage costs, slow queries, and alert fatigue. A cost-aware approach prioritizes:

- Mission-critical signals tied to user outcomes (SLOs)
- Economic efficiency across ingest, storage, and query paths
- Progressive detail: coarse first, deep when needed (on-demand)
- Tool consolidation and data ownership to avoid vendor lock-in

## Principles to Guide Decisions

1. Minimize before you optimize: remove duplicated and low-value streams first.
2. Tie signals to SLOs: if a metric or alert cannot impact a decision, reconsider it.
3. Prefer structured events over verbose logs for business and product telemetry.
4. Use adaptive sampling: full fidelity when failing, economical during steady state.
5. Keep raw where it’s cheap, index where it’s valuable.

## Practical Tactics That Save Money (Without Losing Signals)

### 1) Right-size logging

- Convert repetitive text logs to structured events with bounded cardinality.
- Drop high-chattiness DEBUG in production by default; enable targeted DEBUG windows when investigating.
- Use log levels to route storage: “hot” for incidents, “warm” for audits, “cold” for long-term.

### 2) Adaptive trace sampling

- Keep 100% sampling on error paths, retries, and SLO-adjacent routes.
- Reduce sampling for healthy, high-volume endpoints; increase on anomaly detection.
- Elevate sampling automatically when deploys happen or SLO burn accelerates.

### 3) Metrics with budgets

- Prefer low-cardinality service-level metrics (availability, latency P95/P99, error rate).
- Add usage caps per namespace or team to prevent runaway time-series.
- Promote derived, decision-driving metrics to dashboards; demote vanity metrics.

### 4) Event-first product telemetry

- Track business outcomes with compact events (e.g., signup_succeeded, api_call_ok).
- Enrich events once at ingest; avoid re-parsing massive log lines later.
- Use event retention tiers that match analysis windows (e.g., 90 days for product analytics).

## A Cost-Efficient Observability Architecture

A practical pattern:

- Edge ingestion with lightweight filters (drop obvious noise early)
- Split paths: metrics → time-series DB; traces → sampled store; events → columnar store
- Cold object storage for raw, cheap retention; hot indices for incident triage
- Query federation so responders see a single timeline across signals

This architecture supports “zoom in on demand”: start with an incident’s SLO breach, then progressively load traces, logs, and events only when necessary.

## Budget Policies and Alerting That Respect Humans (and Wallets)

| Policy | Example | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Usage guardrails | Each team gets a monthly metric-cardinality quota | Predictable spend; fewer accidental explosions |
| SLO-driven paging | Page only on error budget burn and sustained latency breaches | Fewer false pages, faster MTTR |
| Deploy-aware boosts | Temporarily increase sampling right after releases | High-fidelity data when it matters |
| Auto-archival | Move logs older than 14 days to cold storage | Large savings with no impact on incidents |

Pair these with correlation-based alerting. Collapse cascades (DB down → API 5xx → frontend errors) into a single incident to reduce noise and investigation time.

## How Tianji Helps You Do More With Less

- Unified feed correlates checks, metrics, traces/events in one place: see [Feed state model](/docs/feed/state) and [Channels](/docs/feed/channels).
- Lightweight server status with quick setup: [server status reporter](/docs/server-status/server-status-reporter).
- Flexible, privacy-friendly telemetry for apps and websites: [telemetry intro](/docs/telemetry/intro), [website tracking script](/docs/website/track-script), and [events tracking](/docs/events/track).
- Custom monitors and synthetic flows to protect SLOs with minimal overhead: [custom script monitor](/docs/monitor/custom-script).

With Tianji, you keep data ownership and can tune which signals to collect, retain, and correlate—without shipping every byte to expensive proprietary backends.

## Implementation Checklist

- Inventory all telemetry producers; remove duplicates and unused streams
- Define SLOs per critical user journey; map signals to decisions
- Set default sampling, then add automatic boosts on deploys and anomalies
- Apply cardinality budgets; alert on budget burn, not just raw spikes
- Route storage by value (hot/warm/cold); add auto-archival policies
- Build correlation rules to collapse cascades into single incidents

## Key Takeaways

1. Cost-aware observability focuses on signals that protect user experience.
2. Use adaptive sampling and storage tiering to control spend without losing fidelity where it matters.
3. Correlate signals into a unified timeline to cut noise and accelerate root-cause analysis.
4. Tianji helps you implement these patterns with open, flexible building blocks you control.
